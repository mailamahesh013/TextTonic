# Notes — Evernote-Style MVP

This small demo is a responsive notes mockup using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It uses localStorage for persistence and is focused on a dark-themed UI mockup that looks like an app screenshot.

How to run:

Open `index.html` in Chrome, Edge or any modern browser. No build tools required.

Features:
- Dark navy background with neon gradient logo
- Search bar and responsive grid (1 to 3 columns)
- `+ New Note` button — prompts for a quick note
- Empty state with placeholder cards and a centered message
- Persistent notes in `localStorage`

Notes:
- This is a mockup MVP — add editing or richer behavior if you want to expand it.
